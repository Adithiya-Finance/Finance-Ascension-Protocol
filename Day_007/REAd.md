### 2. Analytical Approach
1. Start with **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** equation:  
   \[
   WACC = \frac{E}{V} r_e + \frac{D}{V} r_d (1-T)
   \]
2. Break down **debt and equity weights** under two scenarios:
   - **Debt funding:** Increases leverage, reduces WACC due to tax shield.
   - **Equity funding:** Reduces leverage risk, but dilutes ownership and raises required return.
3. Documented a **300-word memo** to simulate IB/consulting-style recommendations.
