## 1. Observation  
Finance formulas appear like a **new language**.  
Symbols such as $FV = PV(1+r)^n$ are compact, but behind them are stories:  
- **PV** is not just a number — it is a choice of measurement at “time zero.”  
- **(1+r)** is not magic — it encodes the assumption that growth is proportional.  
- **Exponent n** is not decoration — it comes from repeating the same structure through time.  

Thus, formulas are not “rules to remember.” They are **abbreviated reasoning chains**.

## 2. Key Questions Raised  
- Why do mathematicians think formulas are *statements of structure*, not recipes?  
- Why does finance borrow mathematical grammar but change its meaning?  
- How do I upgrade from “10th-grade algebra” to reading financial mathematics fluently?

## 3. Reconstruction Attempt  
I tested the expression $(1+r)^n$:  
- At $n=1$: it is $1+r$ → a single period of growth.  
- At $n=2$: it expands to $1 + 2r + r^2$ → reveals interaction between periods.  
- At $n=3$: $1 + 3r + 3r^2 + r^3$.  
Pattern: **Binomial expansion**.  
Meaning: compounding is not linear, it accumulates cross-effects (interest on interest).  

This shows why compounding feels like “magic” — it’s just the algebra o
