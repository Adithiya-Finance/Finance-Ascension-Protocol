# ðŸ“Š Day 11 â€” DCF & WACC Model  

A fully functional **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model with Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** built in Excel. This project is part of my **Finance Ascension Protocol (Day 11)**, where I reverse-engineer valuation formulas from first principles instead of just applying them.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights  
- **Dynamic Inputs Sheet** â†’ Risk-free rate, Beta, Market premium, Debt/Equity, Tax rate.  
- **CAPM-based Cost of Equity** â†’  
r_e = r_f + Î² (E[R_m] - r_f)
- **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** â†’  
WACC = (E/(E+D+P)) * r_e + (D/(E+D+P)) * r_d * (1-T) + (P/(E+D+P)) * r_p
- **FCFF Projection Engine** â†’ 5-year EBIT, NOPAT, CapEx, Depreciation, Working Capital.  
- **Terminal Value via Perpetuity Growth** â†’  
TV = FCFF_(n+1) / (WACC - g)
- **Enterprise Value** = PV(FCFF) + PV(Terminal Value).  
- **Sensitivity-ready structure** â†’ Easily extend to WACC vs g tables.
