 Future Value & Amortization

## Morning Block – FV Derivation
- Formula: FV = PV*(1+r)^n
- Numeric examples: annual, semi-annual, quarterly, monthly
- Step-by-step reasoning for each multiplication

## Morning Block – Amortization Schedule
- Formula: PMT = P * r*(1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1)
- Step-by-step table: interest, principal, remaining balance
- Examples verified digit by digit

## Key Insights
- FV = geometric growth
- Amortization = geometric decay
- Compounding frequency affects total growth
