# 🚀 Day 5 – Protocol Log

## 🔢 Math Block – Algebra Cage-Breaking
- Focus: Variable trapped in the denominator.  
- Problem drilled: Isolate **x** when it is "caged" (e.g. `1/x = 5 → x = 1/5`).  
- Skill: Multiplication & reciprocal as the "unlocking move".  
- Application: This exact move appears inside finance formulas when solving for PV, r, or EMI.

✅ Learned to **not memorize**, but to **liberate variables systematically**.

---

## 💰 Finance Block – EMI Derivation (First Principles)
- Started from **loan structure**: PV = sum of discounted installments.  
- Each installment = \( \frac{C}{(1+r)^t} \).  
- Recognized the **geometric series** pattern.  
- Applied algebra cage-breaking: factored common term, summed series.  
- Rearranged → isolated EMI (C).  

✅ EMI formula reconstructed from scratch, **no rote memorization**.

## 🔄 Reinforcement Block – Generalization
- Protocol principle: **Don’t memorize EMI.**  
- Instead: Train the algebra **muscle memory** across contexts.  
- Same denominator-isolation move shows up in:  
  - Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)  
  - Bond Pricing  
  - Yield to Maturity (YTM) equations  
- Pattern: If cash flow is divided by \((1+r)^t\), algebra must “unlock” it by reciprocal logic.

✅ Takeaway: One **algebra unlock key** applies across **multiple finance locks**.
