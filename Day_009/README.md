ðŸ“Š Day 9 â€“ Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model Rebuild

ðŸ”¹ Key Components

Revenue Forecasting

Base year revenue (2025E)

Growth assumption per year â†’ Forecast revenue for 5 years

EBIT & NOPAT

EBIT = Revenue Ã— Operating Margin  
NOPAT = EBIT Ã— (1 - Tax Rate)


Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)

FCFF = NOPAT + Depreciation - Capex - Î”Working Capital


Discount Factor

Discount Factor (Year n) = 1 / (1 + WACC)^n
PV of FCFF = FCFF Ã— Discount Factor


Terminal Value

TV (End of Year n) = FCFF(n+1) Ã— (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
PV(TV) = TV Ã— Discount Factor (Year n)


Enterprise Value

EV = Î£ PV(FCFF) + PV(Terminal Value)


Discounting: Captures risk and opportunity cost.

Terminal Growth: Reflects going-concern valuation.

FCFF vs. FCFE: FCFF avoids leverage distortions, making EV comparisons cleaner.

Dynamic Design: Change assumptions â†’ Model updates instantly.


This DCF model is structured for sensitivity analysis (Growth vs. WACC matrix) and clean audit trails. 


ðŸ”¹ Deliverable

This DCF model is structured for sensitivity analysis (Growth vs. WACC matrix) and clean audit trails. Next step: Automate a two-variable data table to see how EV reacts to growth/WACC changes.
