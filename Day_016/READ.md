# Day 16 â€“ Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
Part of my **180-Day Finance Ascension Protocol**.  
This repository contains a working DCF model built from scratch in Excel.

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s Inside
- **5-Year Forecast**  
  Revenue â†’ EBIT â†’ NOPAT â†’ FCFF  
- **Discounting**  
  PV of Free Cash Flows at WACC  
- **Terminal Value**  
  Gordon Growth method  
- **Enterprise Value**  
  Sum of PV(FCFs) + PV(Terminal Value)  
- **Outputs**  
  - Excel model (.xlsx)  
  - PDF summary report  

## âš¡ Key Learning
DCF is extremely **sensitive to assumptions**.  
A small 0.5% change in WACC or growth rate can swing valuation by hundreds of crores â€” showing why assumption discipline matters more than spreadsheet mechanics.


## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Add 2-way sensitivity table (WACC vs Growth)  
- Extend to scenario analysis & Monte Carlo simulations
