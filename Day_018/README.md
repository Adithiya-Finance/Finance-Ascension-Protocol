Perfect — let’s design the **Day 18 README.md snippet** so your GitHub looks rigorous and mathematical.
This is not marketing fluff, it’s a **technical log of your reasoning**.

# 📘 Day 18 — Trading Comps (Relative Valuation)

### 🔹 Conceptual Foundation

Valuation can be constructed either:

1. **Intrinsically** → via discounted cash flows (Day 16–17).
2. **Relatively** → via market-observed multiples (Day 18).

The **relative framework** treats valuation as a *ratio system*:

$$
{Multiple} ={Value Metric (EV or Equity)} (Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income)}}
$$

Examples:

* $EV/Revenue = {EV}{Revenue}$
* $EV/EBITDA = EV}{EBITDA}$
* $P/E = {Market Cap}{Net Income}$

Each multiple is **dimensionless** — it rescales performance into a valuation benchmark.

### 🔹 Mathematical Application

1. **Step 1: Peer Calculation**
   For each peer:

   $$
   EV = Market\,Cap + Net\,Debt
   $$

   Then compute:

   $$
   EV/Revenue, \quad EV/EBITDA, \quad P/E
   $$

2. **Step 2: Central Tendency**
   Use mean/median multiples to represent the “market consensus ratio.”

3. **Step 3: Implied Valuation**
   Apply peer multiples to the target company’s metrics:

   $$
   \text{Implied Value} = {Company Metric} {Peer Multiple}
   

4. **Step 4: Triangulation**
   Compare the implied range with the **DCF valuation** (Day 17).

### 🔹 Key Insight

* **DCF** answers: “What is this company worth under discounted future cash flows?”
* **Comps** answer: “What does the market pay per unit of performance for similar firms?”
* Together, they define a **valuation corridor**:

  $$
   {DCF Interval}]{Comps Interval}]
  $$

Valuation is not a single truth but a **mathematical negotiation space**.
