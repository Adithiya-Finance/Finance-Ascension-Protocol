# Day 17 â€” Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) with Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis

This model builds on Day 15â€“16 where I created a base DCF framework.  
On Day 17, I expanded it to include **scenario analysis and sensitivity testing** â€” essential tools for understanding valuation robustness.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Base Case Projections**: 5-year revenue, EBITDA, FCF build-up
- **Terminal Value**: Gordon Growth approach
- **Enterprise Value**: NPV of projected FCF + discounted terminal value
- **Scenario Analysis**:
  - Best Case: higher revenue growth
  - Worst Case: conservative growth
- **Sensitivity Table**:
  - WACC (discount rate) across rows
  - Terminal growth across columns
  - Displays Enterprise Value outcomes under assumption changes


### ðŸš€ Learning Outcome
Day 17 shows how assumptions drive valuation.  
Instead of relying on a single number, I learned to **stress-test models** to reflect real-world uncertainty â€” a core skill for investment banking, equity research, and corporate finance roles.
