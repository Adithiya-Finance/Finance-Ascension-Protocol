# Day 14 â€“ Financial Modeling (Revenue Schedule: Theory)

## ðŸ“Œ Focus
Today I explored the **logic behind revenue projections** before touching Excel.  
Instead of just inputting numbers, I dissected why we model revenue as:

- **Units Sold Ã— Price per Unit**
- Growth in both **quantity** and **price** over time
- Recursive nature (each year depends on prior year)

## ðŸ”‘ Insights
- "1" in (1 + growth) represents the **baseline (100%)**.
- Growth is always applied multiplicatively, not additively, because revenue compounds on itself.
- Projection is not random â€” itâ€™s assumption-driven and scalable.

## âœ… Day 14 Complete
Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll translate these concepts into an **Excel revenue schedule**.
